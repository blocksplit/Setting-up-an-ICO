# Setting-up-an-ICO

ICOs are fundraising processes that issue “shares” of a project in the form of a token to early adopters and enthusiasts in return for funding the project and getting it off the ground. We’ll run our own blockchain, build an ICO from scratch, deploy our own token and get it verified, and run a crowdfunding process. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have built a non-traditional ICO, fully deployed on the Ethereum testnet with usable tokens. Please come earlier to set up in time.

Stack: Basic code editor (vscode, sublime text, webstorm, etc).
